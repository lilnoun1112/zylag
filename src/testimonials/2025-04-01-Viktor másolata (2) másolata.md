text: I've worked with Tamás in 2023 on a webdesign project. He was really
  resourceful and creative for new ideas and solutions. The wireframe and the
  outline of the design was provided, but it wasn't fully developed, so I've
  needed new ideas to make the design into it's final form.  Tamás helped me to
  put the whole website design in a cohesive, multi-page visual with logo and
  also responsive variants. After going live with the project, I've received a
  lot of response for the design itself. Tamás was able to capture my idea to
  make it easy to use and also playful, with bright colors.  I recommend Tamás
  to everyone, who are looking for an experienced and proactive web designer!
