text: Tamás is professional, yet friendly and easy-going. He tailored my website
  exactly to my needs, and created custom graphics which make each page unique.
  Even though the website was created three years ago, I keep getting
  compliments on it, and clients still find it attractive. He also kept all
  deadlines and the pricing was reasonable, too.
