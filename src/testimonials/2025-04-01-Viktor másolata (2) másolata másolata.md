text: I am very satisifed working with Tamas.  Commmunication about design and implementation was done in few effective rounds of iteration, with minimal overhead time needed to explain our wishes and agree on the final details. Development was executed with simplicity and clarity. The result is a website with clean and crisp look and feel, with a customized content management systemÂ tailored to our needs. The process was smooth and effortless with very good results!
